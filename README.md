Encryption,is the process of changing information in such a way as to make it unreadable by anyone except those possessing special knowledge (usually referred to as a "key") that allows them to change the information back to its original, readable form.

Encryption is important because it allows you to securely protect data that you don't want anyone else to have access to. Businesses use it to protect corporate secrets, governments use it to secure classified information, and many individuals use it to protect personal information to guard against things like identity theft.

Espionage uses encryption to securely protect folder contents, which could contain emails, chat histories, tax information, credit card numbers, or any other sensitive information. This way, even if your comptuer is stolen that data is safe.
 
3 reasons why encryption matters

1. Internet privacy concerns are real
Encryption helps protect privacy by turning personal information into “for your eyes only” messages intended only for the parties that need them — and no one else. You should make sure that your emails are being sent over an encrypted connection, or that you are encrypting each message. Most email clients come with the option for encryption in the settings menu, and if you check your email with a web browser, take a moment to ensure that SSL encryption is available.

2. Hacking is big business
Hackers aren’t just bored kids in a basement anymore. They’re big business, and in some cases, they’re multinational outfits. Large-scale data breaches that you may have heard about in the news demonstrate that people are out to steal personal information to fill their pockets.

3. Regulations demand it
Healthcare providers are required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to implement security features that protect patients’ sensitive health information. Institutions of higher learning must take similar steps under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), while retailers must contend with the Fair Credit Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws. Encryption helps businesses stay compliant as well as helps protect the valuable data of their customers.
