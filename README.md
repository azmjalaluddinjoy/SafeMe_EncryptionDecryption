# Safe-Me
I’m using encryption algorithm to make the plain text to the cipher text &amp; the decryption algorithm to make it plain text. User can register &amp; after submitting the proper information he/she can encrypt &amp; decrypt the code/secret messages.

## Abstract
We Share various sensitive & personal data (Ex: mobile, password, pin, amount of taka, account number, secret key etc) to another person through social media or messages. But we never thought about the security of this kind of important data. So, if it is important to share this kind of important data to another, we can encrypt & then send it to other. Data encryption has been widely applied in many data processing areas. Various encryption algorithms have been developed for processing text documents, images, video, etc. If we are able to collaborate the advantages of the different existing encryption methods & use these, we will able to protect our sensitive data if those media has been hacked.

For this problem the messages can be encrypted & being sent. Here I’m using encryption algorithm to make the plain text to the cipher text & the decryption algorithm to make it plain text. User can register & after submitting the proper information he/she can encrypt & decrypt the code/secret messages.

Encrypt-Here the secret message to share is divided and encrypted using Ceaser Cipher Algorithm.
Decrypt- Here the secret message is divided and decrypted using Ceaser Cipher Algorithm.

## The Technologies

#### Type: Web App.
#### Plain text to Cipher text (Encryption/Decryption) Algorithm.
#### Programming Language: C#
#### Framework: ASP.NET
#### Database: SQL Server

# Impact and Intended Results

### The message is secured as it is divided and then each part of the message is encrypted using different encryption algorithm.
### Secret keys are used which enhances the level of security.
 
3 reasons why encryption matters

### 1. Internet privacy concerns are real
Encryption helps protect privacy by turning personal information into “for your eyes only” messages intended only for the parties that need them — and no one else. You should make sure that your emails are being sent over an encrypted connection, or that you are encrypting each message. Most email clients come with the option for encryption in the settings menu, and if you check your email with a web browser, take a moment to ensure that SSL encryption is available.

### 2. Hacking is big business
Hackers aren’t just bored kids in a basement anymore. They’re big business, and in some cases, they’re multinational outfits. Large-scale data breaches that you may have heard about in the news demonstrate that people are out to steal personal information to fill their pockets.

### 3. Regulations demand it
Healthcare providers are required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to implement security features that protect patients’ sensitive health information. Institutions of higher learning must take similar steps under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), while retailers must contend with the Fair Credit Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws. Encryption helps businesses stay compliant as well as helps protect the valuable data of their customers.
